Order types

All-or-None: an order type that must be executed in its entirety, or not executed at all.

Immediate or Cancel (IOC) : a type of order that requires all or part of the order to be executed immediately. Unfilled parts of order are cancelled– sometimes referred to as Fill and Kill (FAK) orders.

Good for Day (GFD) order: a type of order that will remain active until executed (in part or full) or until the end of the trading day. It is then cancelled.

Good-till-cancelled (GTC): a type of order that will remain active until completed or cancelled by the entering party.

Fill or Kill (FOK): an order type that must be executed immediately in its entirety, otherwise the order is cancelled; often with floor trading – market makers have a few seconds to decide to make a trade and can also do a partial order. Sometimes brokers will use this interchangeably with Fill and Kill and will fill partial FOK orders.
